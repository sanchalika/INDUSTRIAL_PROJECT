            <h1 class="head">Hardware and Networking</h1>
            <hr />
            <p class="final">Hardware and Networking is a vast field in India. It is refers to the process of supplying data and information by linking the group of networks using hardwareâ€™s such as switches, hubs, gateways, access points, network interface cards, networking cables. To be more specific, hardware networking includes all peripherals, computers, interface cards and other tools required for communications and data processing in the network.<br/>
            <br/> SNS specializes in IT and Network support and installing business computer networks across India. The Networking company provides broadband, internet services, hardware, offsite backup and VPNs to India's businesses.<br/><br/>
            Computer hardware professionals take care of the maintenance of computer hardware, while networking involves connecting a group of 2 or more computer systems for sharing data and information. The professionals engaged in R&D of computer hardware and networks are known as hardware and networking engineers. Besides looking after computer maintenance they are also liable for supervising and designing the hardware installation and manufacturing process. The increasing use of computer, laptops and internets has expanded the scope of hardware and networking sector widely.<br/><br/>
            In hardware and networking there are a huge number of courses available in India. The courses offered at different levels are - certification, international certification, diploma in hardware & networking and degree courses. The course duration will vary as per the level of the course. The goal of the hardware courses is to offer practical knowledge about the hardware and networking domain so that the students are capable enough to handle real time situations.<br/>
            The top courses in hardware and networking field such as Linux, Cisco certification, MCSE, UNIX admin, CNE, red hat, JCHNE, MNA, ICHNP, ACHNP, Novell, N+, security courses. There are various institutes in India that offer hardware and networking courses either as specialization or as a part of regular full time programs. Some of the institutes are Jetking, IIHT, Infoland, CSC, Cognex, Avera Academy, Hi Tech, Onix academy, KCLBC.<br><br>
            Scope of hardware and networking courses in India<br>
            The recent surveys reveal that the hardware and electronics sector is expected to expand above $60billion in India. The wide recognition of software industry in India dominates the hardware sector. But the situation is likely to change in the near future. The number of hardware and networking jobs is expected to grow extensively in India.
            Presently, the hardware job market is saturated. There is a huge gap between the demand and supply of hardware pass outs. For this reason students are opting to start their ventures for assembling and hardware maintenance. </p>
